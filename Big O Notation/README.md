# Big O Notation

Big O notation is a mathematical expression of upper bounds (worst-case scenario) of the complexity. In Computer Science it is used to estimate the complexity of software running on some hardware.

| Complexity | Notation | Rating |
| - | - | - |
| Constant | O(1) or O(c)| Best |
| Near Constant | O(log(n)) | Good |
| Linear | O(n) | Fair |
| Logarithmic | O(n log(n)) | Bad |
| Quadratic | O(n^2) | Worst |
| Exponential | O(2^n) or O(c^n) | Worst |
| Factorial | O(n!) | Worst |

## Time Complexity

Time complexity refers to the number of steps or time an operation will take to complete. 

## Space Complexity

Space complexity is the amount of space (drive storage or memory storage) an operation will use to perform an operation.
